  - Oh wow! You found Kaptain Kappos secret shrine! You should be very proud, not
    every kid is brave enough to go up all those stairs!
  - "Ok first of all im not a penguin, i\xB4m a Kappa the mythical japanese yokai
    who is known for drowning people...why i am representing a water park for children,
    that i do not know..but yeah! Some respect thank you. "
  - 'Aha! Glad you asked, this my child is a KAPPO SHRINE! There are currently four
    of these badboys around here, who knows something good might happen if you find
    them all! Simply go near it and it will recognize your presence and notify me
    of your progress! '
  - Oh no can do little one, that would surely send me to an early grave! We kappas
    may be magical but we cant survive headless!
  - "What!?! They told on me?! Weaklings, oh well this suit was getting stinky anyway.
    Lets go get food, i haven\xB4t had my lunch yet. IM STARVING."
  - 'Tihi! Hmm.. your friends you say, now that i think about it i did see one of
    them playing around in the water beyond the geyser area. And another one was
    heading for the Onsen mansion! '
  Playerdialog:

  - 'Have you seen my friends? '
